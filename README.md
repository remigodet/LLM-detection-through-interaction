# Rogue LLM detection : an LLM-to-LLM Turing test 
Project made for CS6700 class at Cornell University
## Description

We plan to design an experiment to explore interaction between LLM-based agents. Our goal is to perform detection of a rogue agent having a different next-token distribution (agents with different architecture or  hyperparameters) based on their interaction with an LLM group of agents and a subsequent voting mechanism.
